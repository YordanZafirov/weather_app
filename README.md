# weather_app

The application takes information from API called OpenWeatherMap. If you want to check the weather in a city, you can write the city name in the input field. The API will return temperature, "feels like" temperature and humidity, as well as an icon to show the description of the weather(if it is clear, cloudy, snowing etc.).
